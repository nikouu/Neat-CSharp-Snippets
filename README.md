# Neat C# Snippets
C# snippets that make me say "this will make a fine addition to my collection".

Originally I had another repo [Switch Expression Examples](https://github.com/nikouu/Switch-Expression-Examples) to keep a hold of neat switch expression snippets. However why limit to just that? 

Check out any of the other `.md` files for bits that might interest you.
## Generating Random with `Random.Shared.Next()`
Just a quick way to get a normal random number. [Documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.random.shared?view=net-6.0) and [initial proposal](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/43887).

```csharp
Random.Shared.Next()
```

## Switch Expressions
See my repo [Switch Expression Examples](https://github.com/nikouu/Switch-Expression-Examples) for gathered code snippets.
